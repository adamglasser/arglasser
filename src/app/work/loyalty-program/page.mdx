## Overview

A major internet service provider needed to implement a comprehensive loyalty program to increase customer retention and satisfaction. The solution required a branded customer portal, automated reward fulfillment, and analytics dashboards for program management‚Äîall while integrating with their existing customer management systems.

I was tasked with architecting and implementing this business-critical system to serve customers and process reward transactions efficiently.

## Technical Approach

My approach to designing this loyalty platform focused on scalability, security, and seamless integration:

1. **Microservices Architecture**: Designed a modular system with dedicated services for user management, reward catalog, fulfillment automation, and analytics

2. **Cloud Infrastructure**: Leveraged Azure serverless infrastructure and Cosmos DB to create a responsive, scalable solution

3. **Secure Authentication**: Implemented authentication systems integrated with the client's existing identity provider

4. **Custom Reward Engine**: Developed a flexible rules engine that could evaluate customer activity and trigger appropriate rewards based on configurable business logic

5. **Analytics**: Created comprehensive Tableau dashboards that provided business stakeholders with insights into program performance
