## Overview

A major internet service provider needed to implement a comprehensive loyalty program to increase customer retention and satisfaction. The solution required a branded customer portal, automated reward fulfillment, and analytics dashboards for program management‚Äîall while integrating with their existing customer management systems.

I was tasked with architecting and implementing this business-critical system that would serve millions of customers and process thousands of reward transactions daily.

## Technical Approach

My approach to designing this loyalty platform focused on scalability, security, and seamless integration:

1. **Microservices Architecture**: Designed a modular system with dedicated services for user management, reward catalog, fulfillment automation, and analytics

2. **Cloud Infrastructure**: Leveraged AWS services including Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and CloudFront to create a responsive, scalable solution

3. **Secure Authentication**: Implemented OAuth 2.0 and JWT-based authentication integrated with the client's existing identity provider

4. **Custom Reward Engine**: Developed a flexible rules engine that could evaluate customer activity and trigger appropriate rewards based on configurable business logic

5. **Real-time Analytics**: Created comprehensive dashboards that provided business stakeholders with actionable insights into program performance
