## Overview

A significant growth opportunity presented itself through a potential partnership with a major HR platform. However, this partnership required a robust, webhook-based integration to synchronize data between systems while maintaining strict security and compliance standards.

I was tasked with designing and implementing this critical integration that would enable the onboarding of a strategically important enterprise client.

## Technical Approach

I approached this challenge by:

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Worked closely with stakeholders to understand complex business rules, data mapping requirements, and performance expectations
   
2. **Webhook Architecture**: Designed a streamlined webhook-based integration that allowed Rippling to send data directly to Benepass

3. **AWS Lambda Processing**: Implemented serverless functions to efficiently process and ingest the incoming HR data

4. **Testing Strategy**: Created an extensive testing framework with unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end validation scenarios
