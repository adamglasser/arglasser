## Overview

In a rapidly growing fintech environment, managing the increasing volume of data flowing between various systems became a significant challenge. The existing processes were manual, error-prone, and couldn't scale with the business growth.

I was tasked with designing and implementing a comprehensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) framework that could handle diverse data sources, ensure data integrity, and automate data processing workflows.

## Technical Approach

The solution I architected leveraged AWS services combined with Python and PostgreSQL to create a scalable, reliable data pipeline:

1. **Serverless Architecture**: Utilized AWS Lambda functions to create a cost-effective, event-driven processing pipeline
2. **Data Validation Engine**: Implemented comprehensive validation rules ensuring data quality and compliance
3. **Workflow Orchestration**: Implemented state machines to manage complex and inter-dependent data processing workflows
4. **Monitoring & Alerting**: Integrated Sentry for real-time system health monitoring
